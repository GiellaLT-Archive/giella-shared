!! !!!Symbols
!! Symbols are single character special signs typically denoting whole nouns. They are different from
!! abbreviations and acronyms by not consisting of regular, alphabetic letters.

!! Symbols are syntactic constituents, and thus part of the sentence analysis. That is, they are
!! different from punctuation: punctuation express syntactic boundaries of various kinds, symbols
!! are syntactic constituents.

LEXICON Symbols !!≈ __@CODE@__ contains symbols of two types: those that inflect, and those that don't.
